# BeatEmUp-Game
As the name suggests, it is that kind of BeatEmUp game, just as we can remember the classic Street Fighter and Mortal Combat. It tends more towards a StreetFighter game because it has the specific elements of a street fight, not having the mage / skills elements that Mortal Combat fans are used to.

Game Engine: Unity
